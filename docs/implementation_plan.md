# Implementation Plan for Awesome List Manager (alm)

The following step-by-step implementation plan is organized into five phases: Environment Setup, Frontend Development, Backend Development, Integration, and Deployment. Each step is referenced with relevant sections from the PRD and other provided documents. Remember that when installing Next.js, use Next.js 14 (instead of the latest version) for optimal compatibility with AI coding tools.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

**Step 1:** Confirm Node.js is installed. If not, install Node.js (LTS version) on your machine. (Reference: PRD Section 5, Tech Stack)

**Step 2:** Confirm Python is installed. If missing, install Python 3.11.4 to support the Flask backend. (Reference: PRD Section 3, Tech Stack)

**Step 3:** Create a new project directory named `/alm-project` and initialize a Git repository with `main` and `dev` branches. (Reference: PRD Section 7)

**Step 4:** Set up a standard project structure by creating two subdirectories: `/frontend` and `/backend`, and a root-level directory for Docker configuration. (Reference: PRD Section 6)

**Step 5:** Create a `.env` configuration file at the root to store environment variables (e.g., GitHub OAuth credentials, database URIs). (Reference: PRD Section 8)

**Validation:** Run `node -v` and `python --version` to verify correct installations.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

**Step 6:** Initialize a Next.js project in the `/frontend` folder using Next.js 14 (explicitly required over the latest version for compatibility). (Reference: Frontend Guidelines Document)

**Step 7:** Install Material UI dependencies in the frontend project to support dark theme components. (Reference: Frontend Guidelines Document)

**Step 8:** Create a layout component at `/frontend/components/Layout.js` that applies a dark theme (using web-safe fonts like Arial or Roboto). (Reference: PRD Section 4)

**Step 9:** Develop a header component in `/frontend/components/Header.js` displaying the project logo and title. (Reference: PRD Section 4)

**Step 10:** Create a sidebar navigation component at `/frontend/components/Sidebar.js` that organizes main categories and subcategories and includes real-time search/filter options. (Reference: PRD Section 4 & App Flow)

**Step 11:** Create the main dashboard page at `/frontend/pages/dashboard.js` which displays the hierarchical structure of the imported awesome list (categories, subcategories, and projects). (Reference: PRD Section 4)

**Step 12:** Build an import panel component at `/frontend/components/ImportPanel.js` that allows the user to input a GitHub URL for an awesome list. (Reference: PRD Section 3)

**Step 13:** Implement a notifications component at `/frontend/components/Notification.js` to provide real-time validation and error feedback based on API responses. (Reference: PRD Section 4 & 8)

**Step 14:** Create unit tests for key frontend components (e.g., dashboard) using Jest and React Testing Library. Place tests in `/frontend/tests/dashboard.test.js`. (Reference: PRD Section 7)

**Validation:** Run `npm run test` from the `/frontend` directory to ensure all component tests pass.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

**Step 15:** Initialize a Flask project in the `/backend` directory.

**Step 16:** Create a Python virtual environment in `/backend` and install Flask along with required packages (e.g., SQLAlchemy, requests). (Reference: PRD Section 3)

**Step 17:** Create the main Flask application file at `/backend/app.py` to bootstrap the backend server. (Reference: PRD Section 3)

**Step 18:** Develop an import API endpoint (`POST /api/import`) in `/backend/routes/api.py` that accepts a GitHub URL, scrapes the repository README, and parses Markdown into structured data. Include error handling for non-standard markdown. (Reference: PRD Section 3)

**Step 19:** Implement full CRUD API endpoints for managing projects and categories in `/backend/routes/api.py`. (Reference: PRD Section 3)

**Step 20:** Build an export endpoint (`GET /api/export`) in `/backend/routes/api.py` to generate a compliant, linted Markdown README from the current database state. (Reference: PRD Section 3)

**Step 21:** Develop the database models using SQLAlchemy in `/backend/models.py` for the following tables:

*   AwesomeList
*   Category
*   Project (Item)

Include all specified fields. (Reference: PRD Section 3)

**Step 22:** Configure the PostgreSQL connection in your Flask app to connect to PostgreSQL 15.3. (Reference: Tech Stack Document)

**Step 23:** Create a utility module at `/backend/utils/logger.py` to log all key CRUD operations (e.g., import, edit, deletion, publish). (Reference: PRD Section 8)

**Step 24:** Write unit tests for API endpoints using Pytest in `/backend/tests/test_api.py` to ensure each endpoint works correctly. (Reference: PRD Section 7)

**Validation:** Run `pytest` in the `/backend` directory to ensure all backend tests pass.

## Phase 4: Integration

**Step 25:** In `/frontend/services/api.js`, set up API service calls (using axios) that connect frontend actions (import, CRUD, export) to backend endpoints. (Reference: App Flow Document)

**Step 26:** Update the import panel (/frontend/components/ImportPanel.js) to call the `POST /api/import` endpoint and display any import errors using the Notification component. (Reference: PRD Section 3 & 8)

**Step 27:** Implement GitHub authentication integration on the backend by creating a new route in `/backend/routes/github.py` that handles OAuth callbacks and repository commits. (Reference: PRD Section 4)

**Step 28:** Create a GitHub login component at `/frontend/components/GithubLogin.js` that initiates OAuth/token-based authentication and allows the user to select a repository for syncing. (Reference: PRD Section 4)

**Step 29:** Ensure that all API error responses are captured and forwarded to the frontend for detailed user feedback. (Reference: PRD Section 8)

**Validation:** Perform an end-to-end test by importing a sample awesome list via the UI, verifying database updates, and checking API responses.

## Phase 5: Deployment

**Step 30:** Create a Dockerfile for the frontend in `/frontend/Dockerfile`, using a Node.js base image (ensuring Next.js 14 installation). (Reference: Deployment Instructions)

**Step 31:** Create a Dockerfile for the backend in `/backend/Dockerfile`, using Python 3.11.4 as the base image. (Reference: Deployment Instructions)

**Step 32:** Create a Docker Compose configuration in `/docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate the frontend, backend, and a PostgreSQL service (using PostgreSQL 15.3). (Reference: Deployment Instructions)

**Step 33:** Configure environment variables (GitHub credentials, database URI, etc.) in the Docker Compose file or separate `.env` file to be used by both containers. (Reference: Deployment Instructions)

**Step 34:** Write clear deployment documentation in the root README detailing how to run the application locally and deploy it in production using Docker Compose. (Reference: PRD Section 6)

**Validation:** Run `docker-compose up` from the project root and use tools like Postman or a browser to verify that both the frontend and backend services start correctly and endpoints are reachable.

This comprehensive plan covers all critical aspects of the Awesome List Manager project, ensuring adherence to the requirements, robust error handling, and a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend components. Follow each step carefully and validate using the provided test commands to maintain high-quality and consistent implementation.
